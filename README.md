Number Guessing Game

I have created a number guessing game! The player will be prompted to choose a number between 1 and 100. With each guess, they will be given hints with whether the number is higher or lower. Once the player guesses the number, the game will display the number of attempts made and the mean, mode, and median of the numbers guessed! Try and take a shot at it!
